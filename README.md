# Coursera_Machine-Learning
In this repo I followed closely Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), by Stanford university.


## Certificate 

I have finished the course at the same date I'm updating this `README` file (07/04/2020) and my certification can be verified in the following link:

## Content

The course is originally divided into 11 weeks and the material corresponding to each one of them is stored in a separate folder. Inside each of these folders you're going do find: 

> - **notes:** a folder containing my personal study notes in `PDF` files. 
> 
> (disclaimer: much of the content of these notes is a direct reference and/or copy of the course material provided by professor Andrew Ng and was stored in this repository for organizational and study purpuses only.)

> - **programming assignment:** when applicable, this folder contains a `PDF` file containing the exercise instructions provided by professor Andrew Ng and a subfolder named `ex*` in which are stored all Matlab/Octave scripts necessary to complete this computational task, in particular. 

> - **slides:** in this folder you are going to find the lecture slides that professor Andrew Ng used for that week's lectures.
